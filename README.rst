Extra Information
-----------------
I provide the base trees that I use with Catalyst. Where modifications to the defaults have been made, these
are explained with comments in the .spec files.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
----------------
I provide support through the issues for this repository. I will try my best to answer in a timely matter, but please, only report
issues caused by my modifications to the .spec files or default kernel configs. Anything that can be properly indicated to be
a direct Gentoo issue should be reported to them instead, through the apporopriate support channels.
